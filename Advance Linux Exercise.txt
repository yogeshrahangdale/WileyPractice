1. Create a directory named logs.

mkdir ~/logs

2. Move the log output from the fixGenerator script into the logs directory.

mv fixlog* logs/

3. From the command line, replace all instances of MTHREE in the file with M3 and put the output into a new file named fixlog2.log in the logs directory.

cat fixlog*.log | sed 's/MTHREE/M3/g' > fixlog2.log

4. Run a command to pull all fill messages from fixlog2.log and put the output into a new log file named fills.log.

grep 35=8 fixlog2.log | grep -v 32=0 > fills.log

5. Run a command to pull all cancel acknowledgment messages (39=4) from fixlog2.log into a new log named cancels.log in the same directory.

grep 39=4 fixlog2.log > cancels.log

6. Run a command to create a new log file named partialFills.log and add the partial fills from fills.log to the new file.

grep 39=1 fills.log > partiallFills.log

7. Use awk to create a new file out of the partial fill log that has the following tags only: Symbol (55); 
orderID (11); side(54); fill price (31); fill quantity (32); execution id (17). Name the file parsedPartialFills.log and make sure you print the columns in the order listed here.

awk '{print $7, $9, $13, $10, $15, $16}' partiallFills.log > parsedPartialFills.log

8. Using an editor, remove the first part of every fix tag (so you are left with the value only) and turn the file into a comma-separated list with no spaces. 
This is how you might have to get a file ready to send to a trader.

sed -i 's/[[1-9][1-9]=]*//g' parsedPartialFills.log

9. In the file, add a row of column headers separated by commas. The headers should be Symbol, OrderID, Side, Price, Qty, and ExecID.

sed -i '1i Symbol, OrderID, Side, Price, Qty, ExecID' 
parsedPartialFills.log
awk '{print}' parsed*

10. Save the file as <yourname>.module10.csv in the location specified by your instructor. Submit this file to this assignment page along with your text file.

cat parsed* > Yogesh.module10.csv

11. Make a copy of the cancels file and name it cancels2.log.

cp cancels.log cancels2.log

12. Open the cancels2.log file in an editor. Find the first symbol (tag 55) in the first line and add the letter A to the beginning of the value. (If it was 55=GOOG, it will become 55=AGOOG.)

sed -i 's/55=/55=A/g' cancels2.log

13. Run a difference between the original cancels file and the new file you just edited.

diff cancels.log cancels2.log
