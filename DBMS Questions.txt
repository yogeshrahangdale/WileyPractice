1. Find the problem with ACID, and potential solutions without going to No Sql?

ACID properties can lead to scalability, latency, and complexity issues in relational databases, especially in distributed systems. Potential solutions within the relational database realm include:

Sharding: Distribute the database across multiple servers to balance the load.
Optimizations: Use indexing, query optimization, and in-memory databases to reduce latency.
Distributed Protocols: Implement Two-Phase Commit (2PC) or Paxos for maintaining consistency across nodes.
Resource Management: Upgrade hardware and tune database settings to optimize resource usage.
Eventual Consistency: Apply eventual consistency models and quorum-based replication for better availability.
These approaches can help mitigate ACID-related problems without resorting to NoSQL databases.

2. Explain how ACID Properties are implemented in Distributed DatabaseÂ Transactions?

In distributed databases, ACID properties are implemented as follows:

Atomicity: Achieved using protocols like Two-Phase Commit (2PC), which ensures all parts of a transaction either commit or roll back together.
Consistency: Maintained through consistency protocols such as quorum-based voting and application-level constraints.
Isolation: Ensured with techniques like Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) and locking mechanisms to prevent transactions from interfering with each other.
Durability: Implemented using Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and data replication, ensuring data is not lost after a transaction commits, even if a failure occurs.
