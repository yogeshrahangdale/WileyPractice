Part 2: Log Files
Run the fixGenerator.sh script again from your home directory using the following commands:

cd ~
./fixGenerator.sh &
You should have a fix log output now from running the script earlier.

Run a search for all new order singles in the fix log output and put the output of that search into a file named log in your home directory.
Open newOrders.log in your editor.
Duplicate the first line in the file.
Go to the fifth line in the file and duplicate it also.
Find and replace every instance of MTHREE with M3.
Find and replace every ; (semicolon) with a , (comma) and ensure there is no space after each ,
Save and exit the file
Rename your file to .log and save it in the directory specified by the instructor.


------------------------------------------------------ANSWER--------------------------------------------------------------
Because the log file is randomly generated each time, each person's file will be different. Check specifically for the following:


All the lines are new orders â e.g., 35=D.
The first and fifth lines are duplicated.
All MTHREEs have been replaced with M3.
Every ; is replaced with , essentially creating a csv file.
